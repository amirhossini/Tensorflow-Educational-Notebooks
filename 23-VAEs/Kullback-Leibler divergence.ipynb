At those other locations, $\\log q(x)/p(x) > 0$, so the divergence is increased.\n",

    "On the other hand, if $q$ places probability mass where $p$ does not, then $D_{KL}\\big[q \\ || \\ p\\big]$ is $+\\infty$ - the KL divergence severely penalizes $q$ for locating probability mass where $p$ does not!\n",

    "You can see that the gradient of the estimates' RMSE, an estimate of the MC estimator's standard devation, with respect to $n$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is unsurprising: the estimator's variance is inversely proportional to $n$, so its log standard deviation is a linear function of $\\log n$ with gradient $-\\frac{1}{2}$. As $n$ increases, the Monte Carlo estimates approach the exact value of the KL divergence."
