[__Simple_DNN_and_CNN__](https://github.com/amirhossini/Tensorflow-Educational-Notebooks/tree/main/00-Simple_DNN_and_CNN) is a library of simple Keras code and Tensorflow workflows for regression by DNN and image classification by CNN. DNN Regression example gives a workflow for dealing with tabular data, including useful helper functions for data preparation. The example of image classification by CNN involves vanilla Keras architectures with a workflow for utilization of (1) ImageDataGenerators for in-memory image augmentation and (2) callback function template for early stopping. <br>

[  CNN with Transfer Learning  ](https://github.com/amirhossini/Tensorflow-Educational-Notebooks/tree/main/01-CNN_w_TransferLearning) is a library of Keras code and Tensorflow workflows for in-memory image augmentation as well as transfer learning for image classification. The pre-trained model _InceptionV3_ with custom pre-trained weights is used in transfer learning set-up.

[  NLP_LSTM-GRU-CNN  ](https://github.com/amirhossini/Tensorflow-Educational-Notebooks/tree/main/02-NLP_LSTM-GRU-CNN) is a library involving various different examples in application of deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The provided workflows include (1) an example of processing a JSON data file for sarcasm classification and feeding it into a LSTM model with Embedding layer; (2) an example of Transfer Learning based on GloVe; and (3) IMDB movie reviews sentiment classification with examples of DNN and bi-directional LSTM with Embedding layers.
